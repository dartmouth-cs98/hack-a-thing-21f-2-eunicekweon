# Hack Technology / Project Attempted

## What you built? 

I tried to fix and finish my cloning project with Google Flutter from the last hack-a-thing. 
After this, I have decided to continue looking into Google Flutter, but instead created a 2D game with this application.
This games is a simple game we all have probably played once in our life called Snake.

## Who Did What?

This was an inidividual project and attempt.

For the first part of this hack-a-thing, I finished last week's hack-a-thing.

For the second part of this hack-a-thing, I decided to continue to work with Google Flutter and build a game. I followed a tutorial to create a 2D Snake game. Once I followed the basic steps in the tutorial I tried to add a few additional features that were recommended by the tutorial.

## What you learned

What Worked: In general, I learned that I was able to develop a basic Flutter project. This time it was a 2D game. I actually liked this project a lot more than the previous one that I did. It reminded me of first creating pong in CS1. I found it not too difficult to construct this game, and slowly liking Google Flutter more. I do think Unity games are cool, but wouldn't mind implementing a project with Google Flutter.

What didn't Work: I had a little difficulty in creating custom widgets and adding a few of the additional features to the basic structure of the game that I created. I think this had to do with me trying to navigate and be more comfortable wth the new languages.

Outcome: Working 2D Snake Game with Android Studio
